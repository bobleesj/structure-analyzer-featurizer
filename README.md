# Structure Analysis/Featurizer (SAF)

![Feature Extraction Diagram](assets/img/feature-extraction-diagram.png)

## Purpose

Structure Analysis/Featurizer (SAF) is a Python script designed to process CIF
(Crystallographic Information File) files and extract geometric features. These
features include interatomic distances, information on atomic environments, and
coordination numbers. The script can sequentially process more than 10,000
`.cif` files and generate millions of data points used as ML input data.

:warning: **Caution:** Do you want to generate geometric features beyond binary
and ternary files? Please email me at
[sl5400@columbia.edu](mailto:sl5400@columbia.edu).

## Motivation

The script was originally developed to determine the coordination number and
geometry for each crystallographic site on complex structures [[1](#ref1)].
Then, we further included an interactive functionality for experimentalists and
data scientists to generate structural features from `.cif` file. These features
were engineered to be used as input data for ML models to predict crystal
structures and their properties.

## Features

- 94 numerical features for binary compounds saved in `.csv`
- 193 numerical features for ternary compounds saved in `.csv`

For a complete list of features, see the [Full Feature List](#full-feature-list)
section.

## Scope

The current version supports the processing of **binary** and **ternary** `.cif`
files containing the following elements: `Si` `Sc` `Fe` `Co` `Ni` `Ga` `Ge` `Y`
`Ru` `Rh` `Pd` `In` `Sn` `Sb` `La` `Ce` `Pr` `Nd` `Sm` `Eu` `Gd` `Tb` `Dy` `Ho`
`Er` `Tm` `Yb` `Lu` `Os` `Ir` `Pt` `Th` `U` `Al` `Mo` `Hf` `Ta`. `Ag` `As` `Au`
`B` `Ba` `Be` `Bi` `C` `Ca` `Cd` `Cr` `Cs` `Cu` `Hg` `K` `Li` `Mg` `Mn` `Na`
`Nb` `P` `Pb` `Rb` `Re` `S` `Se` `Sr` `Te` `Ti` `Tl` `V` `W` `Zn` `Zr` `Tc` `N`
`O` `F` `Cl` `Br` `I` `Sm`

:Note: The Pauling CN 12 radii values for some gases [N, O, F, Cl, Br and I] as
well as Tc and Sm were interpolated using Gaussian Process Regression. The CIF
radii for the aforementioned gases were compiled averages of low-temperature
structures from PCD.

### Adding more elements

To include more elements, you need to provide `CIF_radius` and `Pauling_CN12`
values in the `get_radius_data()` function located in `core/data/radius.py` as
shown below:

```python
def get_radius_data():
    """
    Return a dictionary of element radii data.
    """
    data = {
        "Si": [1.176, 1.316],
        "Sc": [1.641, 1.620],
        "Fe": [1.242, 1.260],
        "Co": [1.250, 1.252],
        "Ni": [1.246, 1.244],
        "Ga": [1.243, 1.408],
        "Ge": [1.225, 1.366],
        ...
    }
```

### Atom labeling for compounds

For binary compounds, atoms are labeled as `AB`, and for ternary compounds,
atoms are labeled as `RMX`, where `R=A` and `M=B`. If you want to customize
this, modify the `get_binary_AB_labels` or `get_ternary_RMX_labels` function in
`core/config.py` as shown below:

```python
A_labels = ["Sc", "Y", "La", "Ce", "Pr", "Nd", "Sm",
            "Eu", "Gd", "Tb", "Dy", "Ho", "Er", "Tm", "Yb", "Lu", "Th", "U"]
B_labels = ["Si", "Ga", "Ge", "In", "Sn", "Sb", "Al"]
M_labels = ["Fe", "Co", "Ni", "Ru", "Rh", "Pd", "Os", "Ir", "Pt"]
```

## Getting started

Start with the script via

```bash
python main.py
```

Once the script is started, the user needs to only confirm (1) whether to skip
`cif` files based on the number of atoms in the supercell generated and (2)
choose the folder.

```text
Welcome to CIF Featurizer! This script processes Crystallographic Information
File (CIF) files to extract various features such as interatomic distances,
atomic environment information, and coordination numbers.  It supports binary
and ternary compounds.

Q1. Do you want to skip any CIF files based on the number of unique in the supercell?
(Default: N) [y/N]: N

Available folders containing CIF files:
1. 20240226_huge_file_test
2. 20240402_ThSb
3. 20240303_ternary_binary_test
4. 20240402_URhIn

Enter the number corresponding to the folder containing .cif files: 3
```

### Output

After running the script using `python main.py` and selecting the folder
containing `.cif` files, `.csv` files are generated. For binary compounds,
`binary_features.csv` with 124 features is generated. For ternary compounds,
`ternary_features.csv` with 165 unique features is generated. For all types of
compounds, `universal_featrues.csv` is generated.

### Coordination numbers

The coordination numbers and their geometric values are determined using four
unique coordination determination methods, as detailed in the manuscript
([DOI](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jallcom.2023.173241)). Below is an example from
a site. Once the code becomes more matured, we will further make a better
documentation here.

| #   | CN method              | Central atom label | CN  | R   | M   | X   | Polyhedron volume | Dist from atom to center of mass | Edges | Faces |
| --- | ---------------------- | ------------------ | --- | --- | --- | --- | ----------------- | -------------------------------- | ----- | ----- |
| 1   | Shortest dist          | Er1                | 13  | 5   | 2   | 6   | 89.293            | 0.095                            | 33    | 22    |
| 2   | CIF radius sum         | Er1                | 13  | 5   | 2   | 6   | 89.293            | 0.095                            | 33    | 22    |
| 3   | CIF radius refined sum | Er1                | 13  | 5   | 2   | 6   | 89.293            | 0.095                            | 33    | 22    |
| 4   | Pualing radius sum     | Er1                | 13  | 5   | 2   | 6   | 89.293            | 0.095                            | 33    | 22    |

The coordination number-based geometric information is calculated as the average
based on the min, max, and avg of rows from each central label. As the project
evolves, further refinements and enhancements to the documentation will be
implemented.
