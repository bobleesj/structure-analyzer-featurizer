| Last updated |today|.

Structure Analyzer/Featurizer (SAF) is a Python package to generate geometric features of interatomic distances, atomic environment information, and coordination numbers from a folder containing CIF (Crystallographic Information File).

Citation
========

If you use ``SAF`` in your scientific publication, please cite the following:

- *Digital Discovery*. `https://doi.org/10.1039/D4DD00332B <https://doi.org/10.1039/D4DD00332B>`_

as well as the ``cifkit`` package, which is the engine of ``SAF`` for coordination environment analysis:

- *Journal of Open Source Software*. `https://doi.org/10.21105/joss.07205 <https://doi.org/10.21105/joss.07205>`_

Publications and scientific utility
===================================

Structure features include interatomic distances, information on atomic environments, and coordination numbers. The script can sequentially process more than 10,000 ``.cif`` files and generate millions of data points used as ML input data.

The script was originally developed to determine the coordination number and geometry for each crystallographic site on complex structures [1]_. Then, we further included an interactive functionality for experimentalists and data scientists to generate structural features. These features have used as input data for ML models to predict crystal structures and their properties [2]_.

Here is a list of publications using ``SAF`` towards materials analysis and data-driven materials synthesis:

Getting started
===============

You don't have to write any code. Please visit :ref:`getting-started` to learn how to generate features.

Scope
=====

The current version supports the processing of **binary**, **ternary**, and **quaternary** ``.cif`` files containing the following elements: ``Si`` ``Sc`` ``Fe`` ``Co`` ``Ni`` ``Ga`` ``Ge`` ``Y``
``Ru`` ``Rh`` ``Pd`` ``In`` ``Sn`` ``Sb`` ``La`` ``Ce`` ``Pr`` ``Nd`` ``Sm`` ``Eu`` ``Gd`` ``Tb`` ``Dy`` ``Ho``
``Er`` ``Tm`` ``Yb`` ``Lu`` ``Os`` ``Ir`` ``Pt`` ``Th`` ``U`` ``Al`` ``Mo`` ``Hf`` ``Ta``. ``Ag`` ``As`` ``Au``
``B`` ``Ba`` ``Be`` ``Bi`` ``C`` ``Ca`` ``Cd`` ``Cr`` ``Cs`` ``Cu`` ``Hg`` ``K`` ``Li`` ``Mg`` ``Mn`` ``Na``
``Nb`` ``P`` ``Pb`` ``Rb`` ``Re`` ``S`` ``Se`` ``Sr`` ``Te`` ``Ti`` ``Tl`` ``V`` ``W`` ``Zn`` ``Zr`` ``Tc`` ``N``
``O`` ``F`` ``Cl`` ``Br`` ``I`` ``Sm``.

.. note::

   The Pauling CN 12 radii values for some gases (``N``, ``O``, ``F``, ``Cl``, ``Br`` and ``I``) as well as ``Tc`` and ``Sm`` were interpolated using Gaussian Process Regression. The CIF radii for the aforementioned gases were compiled averages of low-temperature structures from Persson's CIF database.


How to ask for help
